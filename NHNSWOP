Natural Health Network Announces Digital Coin Swop

Natural Health Network, developer of Africa's first public health blockchain will conduct an exchange of NHN Coins,
its peer-to-peer digital currency in a one : one algorithmic swop.

The swap will occur on Bitify on August 30, 2018. Users will need to create a Bitify account because holders of NHN will 
receive NHN-DPOS based on their NHN balance in their Bitify account. 
The swap will take two-to-three business days to clear. Conversion will be 1 NHN for 1 NHN DPOS.

The last day NHN deposits will be accepted at Bitify is August 30 - 2018. Bitify will close deposits, withdrawals and all 
open orders for NHN on the August 30 and the swop will commence.

Any remaining NHN coins following completion of the swop will be burnt (i.e. made unspendable). Bitify will remove the old
Natural Health Network Blockchain and shutdown all nodes for the old chain. 

Bitify will also be testing the Natural Health Network DPOS & will continue to monitor all master nodes until consensus
has been reached.

The new NHN coin is much more valuable, reliable and efficient than the old NHN Blockchain which used proof of work "A technology we won't 
see around for much longer."

This is an exciting time for us as we strive to make the Natural Health Network an ambassador of blockchain technology in the alternative
& complementary medicines space.
