Natural Health Network - Delegated Proof of Stake Hybrid

Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) is a cutting edge algorithm for securing a crypto-currencies blockchain. DPOS solves the problems of both Bitcoin's traditional Proof of Work system, and the Proof of Stake system of Peercoin and NXT. DPOS implements a layer of technological democracy to offset the negative effects of centralization.

With NHN's Blockchain having three consensus protocols we can ensure the reliability and performance of the blockchain, NHN coin holders use their coin balances / 'selected amount' to elect delegates, called witnesses. These witnesses have the opportunity to stake blocks of new transactions and add them to the blockchain at the risk of losing all staked coins if caught cheating "See it as a security deposit". Voting power of the next block is determined by each node selecting another at random if the node has a reliability level of atleast 1. Once all votes have been cased and calculated the winner, becomes the block validator for the current round only. Block validators cannot be chosen twice in a row, and are excluded from the next vote. All previous blocks are validated over 11 000 blocks before the block validators funds become spendable. 

Witnesses & Validators work in sync to keep the blockchain secure by providing a decentralized network of witnesses that is scalable and reliable. 


Our blockchain 2.0 will hold many benefits over the old POW chain. 

Better distribution of rewards: Every node on the network has a fair chance, so any non technical / casual users have the ability to help secure our blockchain in return for a profit of 1% yearly on their initial deposit, in faith that their validation to the network is honest and correct. Anyone can help validate transactions regardless of the amount of NHN you hold but a positive balance is required, not just the rich earn NHN. Our entire blockchain aims for reliability and reliability gets accounted for on our blockchain. (This democratization makes DPOS more decentralized than any proof of work blockchain.)

Real-time Security: Because all nodes constantly speak to one another in real time, and to join the second level of consensus you have to reach a reliability level of atlest 1 therefore any malicious activity / action by a witness can be immediately detected by the level two consensus protocol nodes which have been witnessing the actual / realtime state of the blockchain for more than 1 reliability level. Level three consensus algorithms vote on actions to be taken , who can expel / ban the offending delegate rendering his wallet state worthless on the current blockchain.

Speed: Provides up to 10 x faster processing of transactions compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Efficiency: Consumes 10 000 x less energy. Minimizes the cost of running the network (CPU, GPU, ASIC resistant).

Hardware: Is not reliant on any specialized hardware or technical know how, a average computer will run the NHN DPOS Blockchain.





Role of Delegates

    - A Block Validator is an authority that is allowed to produce and broadcast blocks.
    - Producing a block consists of collecting transactions from the P2P network and signing it with the witnesses private key.
    - A witness spot in the round is assigned at the end of the previous block, after all votes have been tallied.
    - Ensuring their node is always up and running.
    - Collecting the transactions across the network and relaying chainstate to all other witnesses.
    - Signing and broadcasting those blocks, validating the transactions and relaying new TX's across the p2p network.
    


Disincentives for Attacks

    - By choosing not to produce a block, a witness risks getting fired and they lose current stake and profits in the future.
    - A dishonest delegate would only fail to produce a block if they were sure to win something from it.
    - Witnesses can't sign invalid blocks as the blocks are checked over 11 000 Blocks to ensure no fraudulent transactions pass.
